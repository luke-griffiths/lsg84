# Microcontrollers Final Project: Dino Jump Video Game

## Introduction
I created a joystick-based video game using an IMU, microcontroller, and VGA monitor. Why? Because who doesn't like old-fashioned, arcade-style video games. The game has basic features of an arcade game: a cool welcome screen, pixelated graphics, a leaderboard that keeps track of high scores, pause/resume functionality, and a joystick to control the main character. The goal: get as high as possible and avoid getting hit by cannonballs.
